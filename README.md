2. Login to your mastodon, then go to: _Preferences -> Administration -> Server Settings -> Appearance_
3. in _Custom CSS_ put:

`@import url("system/custom/mastodon_aurora.css");`


(alternatively, copy the content of this css and paste directly into the _Custom CSS_ field in Appearance)


### CALLING A CUSTOM FONT

You can @import fonts, e.g. from google (an option is provided), but it is preferable to put required fonts in a local folder and call them from there, to avoid sharing data with external corporations. 
The fonts can be downloaded from this repository, or from: 

- [Noto Sans Diplay](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Display)
- [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope?query=manrope)

and then to be uploaded to your server, to: _your_mastodon/public/system/custom/fonts_


### CUSTOM BACKGROUND for Login & Sign-Up pages
upload an image of your choice to: _your_mastodon/public/system/custom/graphics/_

### CUSTOM THUMBNAIL for accounts that moved
you can download an example from this repository, upload to: _your_mastodon/public/system/custom/graphics/_
